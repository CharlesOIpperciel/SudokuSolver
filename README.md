# Sudoku Solver #️⃣  

This project features a Sudoku solver application built with Python and the Tkinter GUI library. It allows users to input a Sudoku puzzle through an intuitive graphical interface and automatically solves it.  

### Key Features:  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A 9x9 grid for seamless puzzle input.  
- **Automatic Solving**: Uses a backtracking algorithm to solve valid puzzles.  
- **Input Validation**: Ensures the entered puzzle is both valid and solvable.  
- **Grid Management**: Option to clear the grid and input a new puzzle.  
- **Error Handling**: Notifies users if the puzzle is invalid.  

This project provides a simple yet effective Sudoku-solving tool. The initial version was coded in Python, followed by a JavaScript/HTML/CSS version for my portfolio 1.0. However, that version is no longer available, as this is an older project.
