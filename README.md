# SudokuSolver
**JavaScript and CSS/HTML version will also be available on my website @ CharlesOIpperciel.github.io for demonstration purposes.**

This project implements a Sudoku solver application using Python and Tkinter GUI library. Sudoku Solver allows users to input a Sudoku puzzle through a graphical interface and provides functionality to solve the puzzle automatically. It includes features such as:

- User-friendly graphical interface with a 9x9 grid for inputting Sudoku puzzles.
- Ability to solve valid Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm.
- Validation of user-inputted Sudoku puzzles to ensure they are solvable and valid.
- Option to clear the grid and input a new Sudoku puzzle.
- Displays an alert message if the inputted Sudoku puzzle is invalid.

This project is a simple yet effective implementation of a Sudoku solver, providing a convenient tool for solving Sudoku puzzles interactively.
